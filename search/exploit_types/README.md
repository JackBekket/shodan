# Exploit Types Package

## Short Summary  
The `exploit_types` package defines a simple string‑based type and a set of constants that represent common exploit categories. It is intended to be used as a shared definition for other parts of the project that need to refer to or compare exploit types.

---

## Environment Variables, Flags & Cmdline Arguments  
No external configuration options are defined in this file; it only declares a type and constants. If the package is imported elsewhere, those values can be referenced directly (e.g., `exploit_types.DoS`).

---

## Project Package Structure  

```
search/
└── exploit_types/
    └── exploit_types.go
```

* **search/exploit_types/exploit_types.go** – contains the type definition and constants.

---

## Code Relations & Edge Cases  
- The exported type `ExploitType` is a simple alias for `string`.  
- All constants (`DoS`, `Exploit`, `Local`, `Remote`, `Shellcode`, `Webapps`) are of that type, allowing them to be used interchangeably wherever an `ExploitType` value is expected.  
- No functions or methods are defined here; the file serves purely as a shared definition module.

---

## How It Can Be Launched (if it were a CLI/main package)  
Since this file contains only constants and no `main()` function, it is most likely intended to be imported by other packages rather than executed directly. If another part of the project imports `exploit_types`, it can refer to these constants when parsing or serializing exploit data.
