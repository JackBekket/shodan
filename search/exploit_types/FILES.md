## Summary of Major Code Parts  
  
### Type Definition  
```go  
type ExploitType string  
```  
Defines a new named type `ExploitType` based on the built‑in `string`. This allows for clearer semantic meaning when referring to exploit categories throughout the package.  
  
### Constants  
```go  
const (  
	DoS       ExploitType = "dos"  
	Exploit   ExploitType = "exploit"  
	Local     ExploitType = "local"  
	Remote    ExploitType = "remote"  
	Shellcode ExploitType = "shellcode"  
	Webapps   ExploitType = "webapps"  
)  
```  
A set of exported constants of type `ExploitType` representing common categories of exploits. Each constant is a string literal that can be used directly in code or configuration files to refer to a particular exploit type.  
  
These definitions provide the foundation for other parts of the package that will likely use `ExploitType` values when handling exploit data, such as parsing, serialization, or mapping to specific payloads.
